            - [ ] Do the proposed changes actually accomplish desired goals?
            - [ ] Do the proposed changes follow the [STScI coding guidelines](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/python.md)?
            - [ ] Are tests added/updated as required? If so, do they follow the [STScI testing guidelines](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/python-testing.md)?
            - [ ] Are docs added/updated as required?
            - [ ] Is rebase and/or squash necessary? If so, please provide the author with appropriate instructions.
            - [ ] Did the CI pass? If no, are the failures related?
            - [ ] Is a change log needed?
            - [ ] Is a milestone set? Milestone must be set but we cannot check for it on Actions; do not let the green checkmark fool you.`
