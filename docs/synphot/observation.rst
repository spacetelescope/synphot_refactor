Observation
===========

:class:`~synphot.observation.Observation` is a special type of
:ref:`source-spectrum-main`,
where the source is convolved with a :ref:`bandpass-main`; i.e., a photon has
already passed through the telescope optics. It is usually the end-point of a
chain of spectral manipulation. Unlike a regular source spectrum, there is only
one way to create an observation; i.e., by passing in source and bandpass
objects into its constructor. Operations that do not make sense in the context
of an observation (e.g., redshifting, tapering, addition, and subtraction) are
disabled.

An observation also understands detector binning. By default, the bins are
assumed to be the same as the ``waveset`` of the input bandpass. However,
this is not always true, particularly for "obsmode" in **stsynphot**. In those
cases, the bandpass has an extra ``binset`` attribute (wavelength values for
bin centers) that must be passed into an observation's constructor, as shown
below::

    >>> import stsynphot as STS
    >>> from synphot import Observation
    >>> sp = STS.Vega
    >>> bp = STS.band('acs,wfc1,f555w')
    >>> obs = Observation(sp, bp, binset=bp.binset)

It has these main general components:

* ``spectrum``, the input source spectrum
* ``bandpass``, the input bandpass
* ``model``, the underlying Astropy composite model
* ``waveset``, the wavelength set for "native" sampling
* ``waverange``, the range (inclusive) covered by ``waveset``
* ``meta``, metadata associated with the observation
* ``warnings``, special metadata to highlight any warning

It also has these components related to binning:

* ``binset``, center of the wavelength bins
* ``bin_edges``, edges of the wavelength bins
* ``binflux``, binned flux computed by integrating the "native" flux over the
  width of each bin

To **evaluate** its flux at a given wavelength (not binned), use its
:py:meth:`~object.__call__` method as you would with any Astropy model
(except that the method also takes additional keywords like ``flux_unit``
for flux conversion). To get binned flux values, use
:meth:`~synphot.observation.Observation.sample_binned`, where you must provide
the exact bin center(s)::

    >>> obs(6000.5)  # Native (not binned) sampling; Angstrom
    <Quantity 160.95438045640773 PHOTLAM>
    >>> obs.sample_binned([6000, 6001])  # Binned flux in given centers
    <Quantity [ 161.19216632, 160.65695961] PHOTLAM>

To calculate **bin properties** such as covered wavelength or pixel ranges,
you can use its :meth:`~synphot.observation.Observation.binned_waverange` and
:meth:`~synphot.observation.Observation.binned_pixelrange` as follows::

    >>> # Wavelength range covered by 10 pixels centered at 5500 Angstrom
    >>> obs.binned_waverange(5500, 10)
    <Quantity [ 5495.5, 5505.5] Angstrom>
    >>> # Pixel range covered by above wavelength range
    >>> obs.binned_pixelrange([5495.5, 5505.5])
    10

In addition, it has unique properties such as :ref:`synphot-formula-effstim`
and :ref:`synphot-formula-effwave`, which can be calculated in a way
that is consistent with ASTROLIB PYSYNPHOT::

    >>> # Effective stimulus in FLAM
    >>> obs.effstim(flux_unit='flam')
    <Quantity 3.78664384e-09 FLAM>
    >>> # Effective wavelength for binned sampling in FLAM
    >>> obs.effective_wavelength()
    <Quantity 5332.62717945 Angstrom>
    >>> # Repeat for "native" sampling
    >>> obs.effective_wavelength(binned=False)
    <Quantity 5332.62724394 Angstrom>

:meth:`~synphot.observation.Observation.countrate` is probably the most often
used method for an observation.
It computes the **total counts** (a special case of effective stimulus)
of a source spectrum, integrated over the bandpass with
some binning. By default, it uses ``binset``, which should be defined such that
one wavelength bin corresponds to one detector pixel::

    >>> area = 45238.93416  # HST, in cm^2
    >>> countrate = obs.countrate(area)
    >>> countrate
    <Quantity 1.9249653e+10 ct / s>

:func:`~synphot.observation.ccd_snr` is a function which will compute the
signal to noise ratio of an observation given its count rate and exposure
time::

    >>> from synphot.observation import ccd_snr
    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> exptime = 1 * u.s
    >>> ccd_snr(countrate * exptime)
    <Quantity 138743.11880657>

Or, to determine the exposure time needed to reach a certain signal to noise
ratio, use the :func:`~synphot.observation.exptime_from_ccd_snr`
function with the observation's count rate::

    >>> from synphot.observation import exptime_from_ccd_snr
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> snr = 100  # desired SNR of 100
    >>> exptime_from_ccd_snr(snr, countrate)
    <Quantity 5.19489883e-07 s>

An observation can be converted to a **regular source spectrum** containing
only the wavelength set and sampled flux (binned by default) by using its
:meth:`~synphot.observation.Observation.as_spectrum` method.
This is useful when you wish to access functionalities that are not directly
available to an observation (e.g., tapering or saving to a file).

To accurately represent binned flux visually, especially in a unit like count
that is very sensitive to bin size, it is recommended to **plot** the data as a
histogram using ``binset`` as mid-points, as shown below:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import os
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from astropy.utils.data import get_pkg_data_filename
    from synphot import Observation, SourceSpectrum, SpectralElement, units
    from synphot.models import BlackBodyNorm1D
    # Construct blackbody source
    sp = SourceSpectrum(BlackBodyNorm1D, temperature=5000)
    # Simulate an instrument bandpass with custom binning
    bp = SpectralElement.from_file(get_pkg_data_filename(
        os.path.join('data', 'hst_acs_hrc_f555w.fits'),
        package='synphot.tests'))
    binset = range(1000, 11001)
    # Build the observation and get binned flux in count
    obs = Observation(sp, bp, binset=binset)
    area = 45238.93416 * units.AREA  # HST
    binflux = obs.sample_binned(flux_unit='count', area=area)
    # Sample the "native" flux for comparison
    flux = obs(obs.binset, flux_unit='count', area=area)
    # Plot with zoom to see native vs binned
    plt.plot(obs.binset, flux, 'bx-', label='native')
    plt.plot(obs.binset, binflux, 'g-', drawstyle='steps-mid', label='binned')
    plt.xlim(5342, 5372)
    plt.ylim(5.598, 5.62)
    plt.xlabel('Wavelength (Angstrom)')
    plt.ylabel('Flux (count)')
    plt.title('bb(5000) * acs,hrc,f555w')
    plt.legend(loc='lower right', numpoints=1)
