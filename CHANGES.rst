==================

- Compatibility with ``astropy`` 5.0. [#321]

1.1.0 (2021-06-23)
==================

- ``synphot.synphot_utils`` C-extension is no longer optional. Your
  installation will fail if it cannot build. [#297]

- ``~/.astropy/config/synphot.cfg`` is no longer updated on import. [#307]

- Compatibility with ``numpy`` 1.20 and ``astropy`` 4.3. [#301, #309, #311]

0.3.0 (2020-03-17)
==================

- ``SourceSpectrum`` and ``SpectralElement`` now have ``to_spectrum1d`` and
  ``from_spectrum1d`` to write to and read from ``specutils.Spectrum1D``
  object, respectively. [#243]
- ``Observation`` now accepts ``specutils.Spectrum1D`` as a valid source
  spectrum input. [#246]
- Dropped support for Python 3.5 and ``astropy`` 2.x. This version is only
  compatible with Python 3.6 or later and ``astropy`` 3.x or later. [#243]
- Added support for ``RickerWavelet1D`` model that is the renamed version
  of ``MexicanHat1D`` model to be consistent with ``astropy`` 4.0. [#250]
- Added support for extinction curve from ``dust-extinction``. [#251]
- Added option for ``synphot.utils.download_data()`` to download to the cache
  instead of a specific location. Please note that new option is not fully
  compatible with customization using ``synphot.cfg``. [#211]
- Added option to use analytic integral for some models. However, for backward
  compatibility, the default is still trapezoid integration. [#252]
- Trapezoid integration now provides unsigned area for ``RickerWavelet1D``.
  [#252]
