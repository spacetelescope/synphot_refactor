    Calculate the edges of wavelength bins given the centers.

    The algorithm calculates bin edges as the midpoints between bin centers

    Parameters
    ----------
    centers: array_like
        Sequence of bin centers. Must be 1D and have at least two values.

    Returns
    -------
    edges: ndarray
        Array of bin edges. Will be 1D and have one more value
