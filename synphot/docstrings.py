calcbinflux(len_binwave, i_beg, i_end, avflux, deltaw)

Sum over each bin.

Parameters
----------
len_binwave : int
    Number of wavelength bin centers.

i_beg, i_end : array_like
    Locations of bin edges in ``deltaw``.

avflux : array_like
    Average flux associated with ``deltaw``.

deltaw : array_like
    Delta of merge wavelengths (native + centers + edges).
    Values are in ascending order.

Returns
-------
binflux : array_like
    Integrated flux associated with given bins in ascending order.

intwave : array_like
    Integrated delta wavelength associated with ``binflux``.
